Jshell is Javaâ€™s first official REPL (READ-EVAL-PRINT-LOOP) tool which provides interactive use of Java Programming Language elements.

## Variables
When you evaluate any valid java expression, the result will be stored in the system defined variables.

### User-defined variables syntax:
```java
datatype variable name = value;
```

    ```sh
    exit
    ```
* To list all the declared variables.
    ```sh
    /vars
    /vars <variableName>
    /vars <variableSnippetId>
    /vars -start
    /vars -all
    ```
    ### Example:
    ```sh
    jshell> /vars
    |       String name = "OneCompiler"
    |       int id = 1
