AWS

The acronym for Amazon Web Services is AWS.
The AWS service is offered by Amazon, which makes various IT resources available on demand by using a distributed IT architecture. It offers a variety of services, including packaged software as a service, infrastructure as a service, and platform as a service (SaaS).
Amazon created the AWS cloud computing platform so that many businesses might benefit from dependable IT infrastructure.

Some of its features include

Amazon EC2

Amazon S3

Amazon Beanstalk

to name a few..

let us explain it further...

EC2

Users can rent virtual machines using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a component of Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud computing platform from Amazon.com, to run their own software applications. By offering a web service via which a user may boot an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to configure a virtual machine, or what Amazon refers to as a "instance," containing any required software, EC2 promotes the scalable deployment of applications.

Amazon S3

Amazon S3, also known as Amazon Simple Storage Service, is a web service interface-based object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The scalable storage technology that Amazon.com utilises to power its e-commerce network is also used by Amazon S3. Because Amazon S3 can store any sort of item, it may be used for a variety of things, including hybrid cloud storage, backups, disaster recovery, data archiving, and data lakes for analytics.

Amazon Beanstalk

EC2, S3, Simple Notification Tool (SNS), CloudWatch, autoscaling, and Elastic Load Balancers are just a few of the AWS services that are orchestrated by AWS Elastic Beanstalk, an orchestration service provided by Amazon Web Services for the deployment of applications. Users instead see a pre-built OS and platform, such as "64bit Amazon Linux 2014.03 v1.1.0 running Ruby 2.0 (Puma)" or "64bit Debian jessie v2.0.7 running Python 3.4 (Preconfigured - Docker)," thanks to Elastic Beanstalk, which adds another layer of abstraction over the bare server and OS.
